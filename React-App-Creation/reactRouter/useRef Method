# useRef returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to the initial value you provided.

<!-- Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render. -->

By using a ref, you ensure that:

You can store information between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).
Changing it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
The information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).
